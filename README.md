# Exercism Practice & Learning Log

Welcome! This repository contains my personal learning on [Exercism](https://exercism.org/).

## 📌 Purpose

These solutions are published as part of my programming portfolio — to demonstrate how I think, structure code, and solve problems. I am still a beginner programmer, so my style is bound to develop as I go through each challenge.

## 🚫 Please Do Not Copy

This code is **not intended to be used to solve Exercism exercises** or similar challenges. You are welcome to criticise my work — but please do not use my solutions for yourself.
